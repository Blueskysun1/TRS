# Introduction
TRS is a efficient lattice-based traceable ring signature scheme. 

We give this code to test the computational overhead of TRS.
## User Guide
    Main_TRS is a main function, which calls the other five algorithms to realize the simulation experiment of the proposed scheme. Therefore, after downloading them, please run Main_TRS directly.Considering stability, in the code, for our core algorithm, we test 1000 times.
### Concrete steps
```
    Step 1: Run Main_TRS.
    Step 2: In the command line window, enter the ring size as prompted.
    Step 3: In the command line window, follow the prompts to enter the message to be signed.
